/**
 * ShuffleMapStages are intermediate stages in the execution DAG that produce data for a shuffle.
 * They occur right before each shuffle operation, and might contain multiple pipelined operations
 * before that (e.g. map and filter). When executed, they save map output files that can later be
 * fetched by reduce tasks. The `shuffleDep` field describes the shuffle each stage is part of,
 * and variables like `outputLocs` and `numAvailableOutputs` track how many map outputs are ready.
 *
 * ShuffleMapStages can also be submitted independently as jobs with DAGScheduler.submitMapStage.
 * For such stages, the ActiveJobs that submitted them are tracked in `mapStageJobs`. Note that
 * there can be multiple ActiveJobs trying to compute the same shuffle map stage.
